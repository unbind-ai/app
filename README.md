## 🎯 The Problem

Your AI conversations are **trapped**:
- **ChatGPT Teams** — No export option exists
- **ChatGPT Personal** — Export takes up to 30 days
- **Claude, Gemini, others** — Limited or no export
- **All platforms** — Your data is siloed, not portable

You built valuable knowledge across these platforms. You should own it.

## 💬 Why We're Building This

Your AI conversations contain your thoughts, your work, your intellectual property. They shouldn't be held hostage by any company.

**ChatGPT Teams users** can't export at all. **Personal users** wait 30 days. **Claude and Gemini users** have limited options. This is wrong.

**Unbind** exists to give you back control. Export your data. Own your history. Use any AI you want through one beautiful interface.

The future of AI isn't being locked into one platform. It's having the freedom to use the best tools while keeping your data yours.
